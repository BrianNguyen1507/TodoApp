Drawer bar: allows users to switch between pages. Includes Todo list and Complete list.

Update: Implementing the job editing function by going to the job details page and clicking the edit icon on the App bar will display all the information the user needs to edit their job.

Completed task list: Users can view completed lists by sliding the checkmark in the Todo list, tasks will be moved to this list. Here users can delete completed tasks similar to marking in the Todo list.
