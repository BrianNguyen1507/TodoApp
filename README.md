#Exercise: TODO APPLICATION

Welcome to the TODO APP exercise! In this project, I will create a small app that allows people to manage future tasks and mark them as complete.

## Project Overview

This exercise is intended to help you practice your skills in Flutter, Dart, and using SQLite to store data. The application must have the following key features:


### Home page
Display the welcome home page with a banner and a list of tasks to be completed (Todo list). Users can also add tasks from this page.

### Drawer bar
Allows users to switch between pages. Includes Todo list and full list.

### Task list
List of tasks to complete, where users can swipe left to mark completed tasks or click to view task details, including task name, description, date and time, status, priority, etc.
### Add tasks
Allows users to add tasks to a to-do list, displaying the task's status, priority, remaining time, and delay.
### Delete
Delete tasks that need to be completed by pressing and holding the task name.

### Update
Implement the task editing functionality by navigating to the task details page and clicking the edit icon in the Application bar. This will display all the information the user needs to edit their task.

### List of completed tasks
Users can view completed tasks by sliding the checkmark in the Todo list. The task will be moved to this list. Here, users can delete completed tasks, similar to marking them in the Todo list.
