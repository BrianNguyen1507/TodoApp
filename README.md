# Exercise: TODO APP

Welcome to the TODO APP exercise! In this project, you will create a small application that allows people to manage future tasks and mark them as complete.

## Project Overview

This exercise is intended to help you practice your skills in Flutter, Dart, and using SQLite to store data. The application should have the following key features:


### Home Page

Displays the welcome home page with a banner and a list of tasks to be completed (Todo list). Users can also add tasks from this page.

### Drawer Bar

Allows users to switch between pages. Includes Todo list and Complete list.

### Task List

List of tasks to be completed, where users can swipe left to mark completed tasks or click to view detailed information about the task, including job name, description, date and time, status, priority, etc.

### Delete

Remove tasks that need to be completed by long-pressing on the task name.

### Update

Implement the task editing function by navigating to the task details page and clicking the edit icon on the App bar. This will display all the information the user needs to edit their task.

### Completed Task List

Users can view completed tasks by sliding the checkmark in the Todo list. Tasks will be moved to this list. Here, users can delete completed tasks, similar to marking them in the Todo list.
